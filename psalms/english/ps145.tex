1. Praise the Lord, O my soul, in my life I will praise the Lord: I will sing to my God as long as I shall be.

2. Put not your trust in princes: in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.

3. His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth: in that day all their thoughts shall perish.

4. Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God: who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.

5. Who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong: who giveth food to the hungry.

6. The Lord looseth them that are fettered: the Lord enlighteneth the blind.

7. The Lord lifteth up them that are cast down: the Lord loveth the just.

8. The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will support the fatherless and the widow: and the ways of sinners he will destroy.

9. The Lord shall reign for ever: thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation. 

Glory be.

8. Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth.

9. Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains, and herbs for the service of men.

10. Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young ravens that call upon him.

11. He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.

Glory be.
